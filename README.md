# CryptoTithe

CryptoTithe is a basic tax app that does not require uploading all of your data to a centralized service. All your data is stored locally. The only external requests made are to `cryptocompare.com` in order to get USD values for calculating gains.  In the future hopefully you will be able to just provide a file with the USD rate and no external requests will be needed.

## How to Get Started
  1. Clone the repo or download as a zip
  2. Run `npm install`
  3. Run `npm run start`
